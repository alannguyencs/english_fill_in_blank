Specifically, how lasers can be used to measure distances, estimate speed, and map terrains. 

When it comes to robotics, they're generally better at detecting objects than ultrasonic sensors, or those sharp infrared proximity sensors.

However, lidar units, even the hobby kind, are generally more expensive and should be reserved for serious robotics only.

But that's why you're here right to build serious robots.

When I shine a flashlight on something, light leaves the bulb, travels to the
closest surface, and then bounces off.

What you're seeing is actually reflected light from those surfaces.

It may seem instantaneous, but light actually takes some time to travel from
the bulb to my face and then to your eyes or the camera in this case.

The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second but for our purposes, we'll say it's about 300 million meters per second.

LiDAR units contain a laser that emits short bursts of light. 

This light bounces off nearby objects and some of that light is returned to the receiver in the lidar.

The receiver is usually a photodiode that provides some kind of electrical
signal to denote that the returned pulse has been received.
